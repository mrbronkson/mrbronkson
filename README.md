## Work Experience

Continental Automotive
Artificial Intelligence Engineer, Sr. Staff
Aug 2023 ‚Äì Jun 2024
Mexico

- Developed a model for estimation of state of health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Lifetime of lead acid batteries from current, voltage and temperature sensor readings.
	- Extracted over 30k sample windows containing the cranking events from 10 different batteries stored in parquet files.
	- Scaled and centered cranking windows of the 3 sensors and performed data exploration.
	- Managed and stored the data and experiments using DVC and an S3 bucket.
	- Fitted a linear regression to label SOH data based on interpolation of laboratory checkups.
	- Obtained 70% prediction accuracy in 3-fold cross validation with a random forest and 60% with a Resnet of 30 layers.
- Advisor on the strategy and feasibility of other AI initiatives in the organization (AI for software requirements and chatbots).
